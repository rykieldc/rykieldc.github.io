        <h2>What is Application Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Web Application Development is the process of creating and maintaining web
          applications, which are software programs that run on a web server and are
          accessed through a web browser. Web applications are designed to provide a
          user-friendly interface and interactive experience for users, allowing them to
          perform various tasks and functions online.


        <p>
          Furthermore, it involves several key components, including
          front-end development, back-end development, and database management. Front-end
          development focuses on the user interface and experience, using technologies
          such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development deals with the
          server-side logic and functionality, using programming languages such as
          Python, Ruby, and Java. Database management involves storing and retrieving
          data from a database, using technologies such as SQL and NoSQL.


        <p>
          Also, web application development requires a strong understanding of web
          technologies, programming languages, and software development principles. It
          also involves problem-solving skills, creativity, and attention to detail. With
          the increasing demand for web applications in various industries, web
          application development has become a valuable skill set for many professionals.

        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to
          very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning
          fast performance. Moreover, it outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with
          features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

        <strong class="sub-title-1">Clone Repository</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.</li>
          <li>Above the list of files, click &lt;&gt;<strong>Code</strong>.</li>
          <li>Copy the URL for the repository.</li>
          <li>Open cmd or terminal or any of your preferred CLI.</li>
          <li>
            Select the best location for you to clone. Change the current working directory to
            the location where you want the cloned directory. For example you want to clone it in C:/Users/PC,

            <code class="code-block"> C:\>
              C:\>cd Users\PC 
              C:\Users\PC> 
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Type <code class="code-inline">git clone</code>, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
            <code class="code-block">git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Press <strong>Enter</strong> to create your local clone.
            <code class="code-block">$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
            > Cloning into `PC`...
            > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
            > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
            > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
            > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
          </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            After successfully cloning, bear in mind that a new folder is created—which is your
            repository folder. Don’t forget to move inside that folder before issuing the git
            commands later. To do this, change the directory by typing <code
              class="code-inline">cd [repository name]</code>.

          <h2>Git Add</h2>
          <p>The <code class="code-inline">git add</code> command adds new or changed files in your working directory to
            the Git staging area.</p>
          <p><code class="code-inline">git add</code> is an important command - without it, no <code
              class="code-inline">git commit</code> would ever do anything. Sometimes, <code
              class="code-inline">git add</code> can have a reputation for being an unnecessary step in development. But
            in reality, <code class="code-inline">git add</code> is an important and powerful tool. <code
              class="code-inline">git add</code> allows you to shape history without changing how you work.</p>
          <div>
            <h3>When do you use <code class="code-inline">git add</code>?</h3>
            <code class="code-block">git add README.md</code>
            <p>As you're working, you change and save a file, or multiple files. Then, before you commit, you must <code
                class="code-inline">git add</code>. This step allows you to choose what you are going to commit. Commits
              should be logical, atomic units of change - but not everyone works that way. Maybe you are making changes
              to files that <em>aren't</em> logical or atomic units of change. <code class="code-inline">git add</code>
              allows you to systematically shape your commits and your history anyway.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>What Does Git Add Do?</h3>
            <p><code class="code-inline">git add [filename]</code> selects that file, and moves it to the staging area,
              marking it for inclusion in the next commit. You can select all files, a directory, specific files, or
              even specific parts of a file for staging and commit.</p>
            <p>This means if you <code class="code-inline">git add</code> a deleted file the <em>deletion</em> is staged
              for commit. The language of "add" when you're actually "deleting" can be confusing. If you think or use
              <code class="code-inline">git stage</code> in place of <code class="code-inline">git add</code>, the
              reality of what is happening may be more clear.
            </p>
            <p><code class="code-inline">git add</code> and <code class="code-inline">git commit</code> go together hand
              in hand. They don't work when they aren't used together. And, they both work best when used thinking of
              their joint functionality.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>How to Use <code class="code-inline">git add</code></h3>

        <div>
          <h2>Git Commit</h2>
          <p><code class="code-inline">git commit</code> creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository.
            These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times. You should make new commits often,
            based around logical units of change. Over time, commits should tell a story of the history of your
            repository and how it came to be the way that it currently is. Commits include lots of metadata in addition
            to the contents and message, like the author, timestamp, and more.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>How Git Commit Works</h3>
            <p>Commits are the building blocks of "save points" within Git's version control.</p>
            <div>
              <code
                class="code-block">git commit -m "<span>update the README.md with link to contributing guide</span>"</code>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Commits shape history</h3>
              <p>By using commits, you're able to craft history intentionally and safely. You can make commits to
                different branches, and specify exactly what changes you want to include. Commits are created on the
                branch that you're currently checked out to (wherever HEAD is pointing) so it's always a good idea to
                run <code class="code-inline">git status</code> before making a commit, to check that you're checked-out
                to the branch that you intend to be. Before you commit, you will need to stage any new changes that
                you'd like to include in the commit using <code class="code-inline">git add [file]</code>.</p>
              <p>Commits are lightweight SHA hashes, objects within Git. As long as you're working with text files, you
                won't need to worry about how many files you have, how big they are, or how many commits you make. Git
                can handle it!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Committing in two phases</h3>
              <p>Commits have two phases to help you craft commits properly. Commits should be logical, atomic units of
                change that represent a specific idea. But, not all humans work that way. You may get carried away and
                end up solving two or three problems before you remember to commit! That's OK - Git can handle that.
                Once you're ready to craft your commits, you'll use <code
                  class="code-inline">git add &lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> to specify the files that you'd like to "stage"
                for commit. Without adding any files, the command <code class="code-inline">git commit</code> won't
                work. Git only looks to the staging area to find out what to commit. Staging, or adding, files, is
                possible through the command line, and also possible with most Git interfaces like GitHub Desktop by
                selecting the lines or files that you'd like to stage.</p>
              <p>You can also use a handy command, <code class="code-inline">git add -p</code>, to walk through the
                changes and separate them out, even if they're in the same file.</p>

            <div>
              <h3>Common usages and options for Git Commit</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><code class="code-inline">git commit</code>: This starts the commit process, but since it doesn't
                  include a <code class="code-inline">-m</code> flag for the message, your default text editor will be
                  opened for you to create the commit message. If you haven't configured anything, there's a good chance
                  this will be VI or Vim. (To get out, press esc, then <code class="code-inline">:w</code>, and then
                  Enter. :wink:)</li>
                <li><code class="code-inline">git commit -m "descriptive commit message"</code>: This starts the commit
                  process, and allows you to include the commit message at the same time.</li>
                <li><code class="code-inline">git commit -am "descriptive commit message"</code>: In addition to
                  including the commit message, this option allows you to skip the staging phase. The addition of <code
                    class="code-inline">-a</code> will automatically stage any files that are already being tracked by
                  Git (changes to files that you've committed before).</li>
                <li><code class="code-inline">git commit --amend</code>: Replaces the most recent commit with a new
                  commit. (More on this later!)</li>

              <h3>How to Undo Commits in Git</h3>
              <p>Sometimes, you may need to change history. You may need to undo a commit. If you find yourself in this
                situation, there are a few very important things to remember:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If you are "undoing" a commit that exists on the remote, you could create big problems for your
                  collaborators</li>
                <li>Undoing a commit on work that you only have locally is much safer</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>What can go wrong while changing history?</h3>
              <p>Changing history for collaborators can be problematic in a few ways. Imagine - You and another
                collaborator have the same repository, with the same history. But, they make a change that
                <em>deletes</em> the most recent commit. They continue new commits from the commit directly before that.
                Meanwhile, you keep working <em>with</em> the commit that the collaborator tried to delete. When they
                push, they'll have to 'force push', which should show to them that they're changing history.
                <strong>What do you think will happen when you try to push?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>In dramatic cases, Git may decide that the histories are too different and the projects are no longer
                related. This is uncommon, but a big problem.</p>
              <p>The most common result is that your <code class="code-inline">git push</code> would return the
                "deleted" commit to shared history. (First, you would <code class="code-inline">git pull</code> if you
                were working on the same branch, and then merge, but the results would be the same.) This means that
                whatever was so important to delete is now back in the repository. A password, token, or large binary
                file may return without ever alerting you.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4><code class="code-inline">git revert</code></h4>
              <p><code class="code-inline">git revert</code> is the safest way to change history with Git. Instead of
                deleting existing commits, <code class="code-inline">git revert</code> looks at the changes introduced
                in a specific commit, then applies the inverse of those changes in a new commit. It functions as an
                "undo commit" command, without sacrificing the integrity of your repository's history. <strong><code
                    class="code-inline">git revert</code> is always the recommended way to change history when it's
                  possible</strong>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4><code class="code-inline">git reset</code></h4>
              <p>Sometimes, a commit includes sensitive information and needs to actually be deleted. <code
                  class="code-inline">git reset</code> is a very powerful command that may cause you to lose work. By
                resetting, you move the <code class="code-inline">HEAD</code> pointer and the branch pointer to another
                point in time - maybe making it seem like the commits in between never happened! Before using <code
                  class="code-inline">git reset</code>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make sure to talk with your team about any shared commits</li>
                <li>Research the three types of reset to see which is right for you (--soft, --mixed, --hard)</li>
                <li>Commit any work that you don't want to be lost intentionally - work that is committed can be gotten
                  back, but uncommitted work cannot</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4><code class="code-inline">git reflog</code></h4>
              <p>If you're changing history and undoing commits, you should know about <code
                  class="code-inline">git reflog</code>. If you get into trouble, the reflog could get you out of
                trouble. The reflog is a log of every commit that <code class="code-inline">HEAD</code> has pointed to.
                So, for example, if you use <code class="code-inline">git reset</code> and unintentionally lose commits,
                you can find and access them with <code class="code-inline">git reflog</code>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Updating Commits With Git Commit Amend</h3>
              <p>While <code class="code-inline">git commit --amend</code> does change history, it only changes the most
                recent commit on your current branch. This can be an extremely useful command for commits that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Haven't been pushed to the remote yet</li>
                <li>Have a spelling error in the commit message</li>
                <li>Don't contain the changes that you'd like to contain</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Git Push</h2>
          <div>
            <code class="code-block">git push</code>
          </div>
          <p><code class="code-inline">git push</code> uploads all local branch commits to the corresponding remote
            branch.</p>
          <div>
            <h3>What Does <code class="code-inline">git push</code> Do?</h3>
            <p><code class="code-inline">git push</code> updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the
              four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository. You can also think of <code
                class="code-inline">git push</code> as <em>update</em> or <em>publish</em>.</p>
            <p>By default, <code class="code-inline">git push</code> only updates the corresponding branch on the
              remote. So, if you are checked out to the <code class="code-inline">main</code> branch when you execute
              <code class="code-inline">git push</code>, then only the <code class="code-inline">main</code> branch will
              be updated. It's always a good idea to use <code class="code-inline">git status</code> to see what branch
              you are on before pushing to the remote.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>How to Use <code class="code-inline">git push</code></h3>
            <p>After you make and commit changes locally, you can share them with the remote repository using <code
                class="code-inline">git push</code>. Pushing changes to the remote makes your commits accessible to
              others who you may be collaborating with. This will also update any open pull requests with the branch
              that you're working on.</p>
            <p>As best practice, it's important to run the <code class="code-inline">git pull</code> command before you
              push any new changes to the remote branch. This will update your local branch with any new changes that
              may have been pushed to the remote from other contributors. Pulling before you push can reduce the amount
              of merge conflicts you create on GitHub - allowing you to resolve them locally before pushing your changes
              to the remote branch.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Common usages and options for <code class="code-inline">git push</code></h3>
            <ul>
              <li><code class="code-inline">git push -f</code>: Force a push that would otherwise be blocked, usually
                because it will delete or overwrite existing commits <em>(Use with caution!)</em></li>
              <li><code class="code-inline">git push -u origin [branch]</code>: Useful when pushing a new branch, this
                creates an upstream tracking branch with a lasting relationship to your local branch</li>
              <li><code class="code-inline">git push --all</code>: Push all branches</li>
              <li><code class="code-inline">git push --tags</code>: Publish tags that aren't yet in the remote
                repository</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why can't I push?</h3>
            <p>If you are trying to <code class="code-inline">git push</code> but are running into problems, there are a
              few common solutions.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Check your branch</h4>
            <p>Check what branch you are currently on with <code class="code-inline">git status</code>. If you are
              working on a protected branch, like <code class="code-inline">main</code>, you may be unable to push
              commits directly to the remote. If this happens to you, it's OK! You can fix this a few ways.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Work was not yet on any branch</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Create and checkout to a new branch from your current commit: <code
                  class="code-inline">git checkout -b [branchname]</code></li>
              <li>Then, push the new branch up to the remote: <code
                  class="code-inline">git push -u origin [branchname]</code></li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Accidentally committed to the wrong branch</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Checkout to the branch that you intended to commit to: <code
                  class="code-inline">git checkout [branchname]</code></li>
              <li>Merge the commits from the branch that you <em>did</em> accidentally commit to: <code
                  class="code-inline">git merge [main]</code></li>
              <li>Push your changes to the remote: <code class="code-inline">git push</code></li>
              <li>Fix the other branch by checking out to that branch, finding what commit it <em>should</em> be pointed
                to, and using <code class="code-inline">git reset --hard</code> to correct the branch pointer</li>

          <h2>Git Pull</h2>
          <p><code class="code-inline">git pull</code> updates your current local working branch, and all of the remote
            tracking branches. It's a good idea to run <code class="code-inline">git pull</code> regularly on the
            branches you are working on locally.</p>
          <p>Without <code class="code-inline">git pull</code>, (or the effect of it,) your local branch wouldn't have
            any of the updates that are present on the remote.</p>
          <div>
            <h4>What Does <code class="code-inline">git pull</code> Do?</h4>
            <div>
              <code class="code-block">git pull</code>
            </div>
            <p><code class="code-inline">git pull</code> is one of the 4 remote operations within Git. Without running
              <code class="code-inline">git pull</code>, your local repository will never be updated with changes from
              the remote. <code class="code-inline">git pull</code> should be used every day you interact with a
              repository with a remote, at the minimum. That's why <code class="code-inline">git pull</code> is one of
              the most used Git commands.
            </p>
            <div>
              <h4><code class="code-inline">git pull</code> and <code class="code-inline">git fetch</code></h4>
              <p><code class="code-inline">git pull</code>, a combination of <code class="code-inline">git fetch</code>
                + <code class="code-inline">git merge</code>, updates some parts of your local repository with changes
                from the remote repository. To understand what is and isn't affected by <code
                  class="code-inline">git pull</code>, you need to first understand the concept of remote tracking
                branches. When you clone a repository, you clone one working branch, <code
                  class="code-inline">main</code>, and all of the remote tracking branches. <code
                  class="code-inline">git fetch</code> updates the remote tracking branches. <code
                  class="code-inline">git merge</code> will update your current branch with any new commits on the
                remote tracking branch.</p>
              <p><code class="code-inline">git pull</code> is the most common way to update your repository.</p>
              <p>However, you may want to use <code class="code-inline">git fetch</code> instead. One reason to do this
                may be that you expect conflicts. Conflicts can occur in this way if you have new local commits, and new
                commits on the remote. Just like a merge conflict that would happen between two different branches,
                these two different lines of history could contain changes to the same parts of the same file. If you
                first operate <code class="code-inline">git fetch</code>, the merge won't be initiated, and you won't be
                prompted to solve the conflict. This gives you the flexibility to resolve the conflict later without the
                need of network connectivity.</p>
              <p>Another reason you may want to run <code class="code-inline">git fetch</code> is to update to all
                remote tracking branches before losing network connectivity. If you run <code
                  class="code-inline">git fetch</code>, and then later try to run <code
                  class="code-inline">git pull</code> without any network connectivity, the <code
                  class="code-inline">git fetch</code> portion of the <code class="code-inline">git pull</code>
                operation will fail.</p>
              <p>If you do use <code class="code-inline">git fetch</code> instead of <code
                  class="code-inline">git pull</code>, make sure you remember to <code
                  class="code-inline">git merge</code>. Merging the remote tracking branch into your own branch ensures
                you will be working with any updates or changes.</p>

        <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to style and layout the visual presentation of HTML documents.</li>
          <li>It allows you to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page.</li>
          <li>CSS is applied either internally within an HTML document, externally in a separate stylesheet file, or
            inline
            within HTML tags.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example of a simple CSS style rule:</p>
        <pre><code class="code-block-ws">
          body {
              font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
              background-color: #f4f4f4;
          }
          
          h1 {
              color: #333;
          }
          
          nav ul {
              list-style: none;
              margin: 0;
              padding: 0;
          }
          
          footer {
              background-color: #333;
              color: #fff;
              text-align: center;
              padding: 10px;
          }

          <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive behavior on web pages.</li>
            <li>It can manipulate the content and structure of HTML, handle user input, and communicate with servers
              (Ajax).</li>
            <li>JavaScript is commonly used to create features like sliders, form validation, pop-up messages, and more.
            </li>
            <li>It can be included directly within HTML documents or linked externally.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example of a simple JavaScript script:</p>
          <pre><code class="code-block">
        // Simple alert when the page loads
        window.onload = function() {
            alert("Welcome to our website!");
        }
        
        // Example of handling a button click
        function displayMessage() {
            var message = "Button clicked!";
            console.log(message);
            alert(message);
        }

        </div>
        <p>
          These three technologies (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript) work together to create modern, dynamic, and visually
          appealing websites and web applications. As you progress in web development, you'll likely use frameworks and
          libraries that build upon these core technologies, such as React, Angular, or Vue for JavaScript, and
          Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.

        <div>
          <strong class="sub-title-1">Evolution of CSS</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS was developed to standardize display information</li>
            <li>CSS was slow to be supported by browsers</li>
            <li>Newer browsers offer more complete support</li>
            <li>Latest release is CSS3</li>
            <li>CSS3 is not yet evenly supported</li>
          </ul>

          <strong class="sub-title-1">CSS Style Rules</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>In CSS, style rules express the style characteristics for an HTML element</li>
            <li>A set of style rules is called a style sheet</li>
            <li>Style rules are easy to write and interpret</li>
            <li>Style rules are composed of two parts: a selector and a declaration</li>
            <li>The selector determines the element to which the rule is applied</li>
            <li>The declaration details the exact property values</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <strong class="sub-title-1">CSS Style Rules</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The declaration contains a property and a value</li>
            <li>The property is a quality or characteristic</li>
            <li>The precise specification of the property is contained in the value</li>
            <li>CSS includes a wide variety of different properties, each with a specific number of values</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <strong class="sub-title-1">Combining CSS Style Rules with HTML</strong>
          <p>You can combine CSS with HTML in three ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline style</li>
            <li>Internal style sheet</li>
            <li>External style sheet</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <strong class="sub-title-1">Using External Style Sheets</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>External style sheets let you specify rules for multiple Web pages</li>
            <li>These are text documents that contain style rules</li>
            <li>External style sheets have a .css extension</li>

          </ul>
          <hr>
          <strong class="sub-title-1">Linking to an External Style Sheet</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The link element lets you specify an external style sheet</li>
            <li>It is used within the section of a document</li>
          </ul>
          <code class="code-block-ws">&lt;link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</code>

          <strong class="sub-title-1">Using Internal Style Sheets</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Internal style sheets are contained within the &lt;style&gt; element</li>
            <li>The style element is contained within the &lt;head&gt; section of the document</li>
            <li>Style rules contained in an internal style sheet only affect the document in which they reside</li>

          <strong class="sub-title-1">Using Inline Styles</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>You can define styles for a single element with the style attribute</li>
            <li>The style attribute can be used to override a style that was set at a higher level</li>
            <li>The style attribute is useful for testing styles during development</li>
            <li>This is the least used method of applying CSS styles</li>
          </ul>

      <h1 class="title">Flexbox</h1>
      <hr>
      <article>
        <h2>What is Flexbox?</h2>
        <strong class="sub-title-1">Background</strong>
        <p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at
          providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when
          their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).</p>

        <strong class="sub-title-1">Basics and terminology</strong>
        <p>Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole
          set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex
          container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).</p>

        <strong class="sub-title-2">If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex
          layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification,
          explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.</strong>
        <p>Items will be laid out following either the <code class="code-inline">main axis</code> (from <code
            class="code-inline">main-start</code> to <code class="code-inline">main-end</code>) or the cross axis (from
          <code class="code-inline">cross-start</code> to <code class="code-inline">cross-end</code>).
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>main axis</strong> &#8211; The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex
            items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the <code
              class="code-inline">flex-direction</code> property (see below).</li>
          <li><strong>main-start | main-end</strong> &#8211; The flex items are placed within the container starting
            from main-start and going to main-end.</li>
          <li><strong>main size</strong> &#8211; A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is
            the item's main size. The flex item's main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property,
            whichever is in the main dimension.</li>
          <li><strong>cross axis</strong> &#8211; The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its
            direction depends on the main axis direction.</li>
          <li><strong>cross-start | cross-end</strong> &#8211; Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the
            container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.</li>
          <li><strong>cross size</strong> &#8211; The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross
            dimension, is the item's cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in
            the cross dimension.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong class="sub-title-1">Flexbox Properties</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong class="sub-title-1">Properties for the Parent (flex container)</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                display
                <p>
                  This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context
                  for all its direct children.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                    .container {
                        display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
                    }</code>
              </li>

              <li>
                flex-direction
                <p>
                  This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex
                  container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex
                  items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                .container {
                    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
                }</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                flew-wrap
                <p>
                  By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to
                  wrap as needed with this property.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                .container {
                    flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
                }</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                flex-flow
                <p>
                  This is a shorthand for the <code class="code-inline">flex-direction</code> and <code
                    class="code-inline">flex-wrap properties</code>, which together define the flex container’s main and
                  cross axes. The default value is <code class="code-inline">row nowrap</code>.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                .container {

              </li>
              <li>
                justify-content
                <p>
                  This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when
                  either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum
                  size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                .container {
                    justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;

              <li>
                align-items
                <p>
                  This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current
                  line. Think of it as the <code class="code-inline">justify-content</code> version for the cross-axis
                  (perpendicular to the main-axis).
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                .container {

              <li>
                align-content
                <p>
                  This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to
                  how <code class="code-inline">justify-content</code> aligns individual items within the main-axis.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">

              <li>
                gap, row-gap, column-gap
                <p>
                  The <code class="code-inline">gap</code> property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It
                  applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edges.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                .container {

                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                  .item {
                    flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
                  }</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                flex-basis
                <p>This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a
                  length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The <code class="code-inline">auto</code> keyword means
                  "look at my width or height property" (which was temporarily done by the <code
                    class="code-inline">main-size</code> keyword until deprecated). The <code
                    class="code-inline">content</code> keyword means "size it based on the item's content" &#8211; this
                  keyword isn't well supported yet, so it's hard to test and harder to know what its brethren <code
                    class="code-inline">max-content</code>, <code class="code-inline">min-content</code>, and <code
                    class="code-inline">fit-content</code> do.</p>

                <code class="code-block-ws">
                  .item {
                    flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */
                  }</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                flex
                <p>This is the shorthand for <code class="code-inline">flex-grow,</code> <code
                    class="code-inline">flex-shrink</code> and <code class="code-inline">flex-basis</code> combined. The
                  second and third parameters (<code class="code-inline">flex-shrink</code> and <code
                    class="code-inline">flex-basis</code>) are optional. The default is <code
                    class="code-inline">0 1 auto</code>, but if you set it with a single number value, like <code
                    class="code-inline">flex: 5;</code>, that changes the <code class="code-inline">flex-basis</code> to
                  0%, so it's like setting <code
                    class="code-inline">flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;</code>.</p>

                <code class="code-block-ws">
                  .item {
                    flex: none | [ &lt;'flex-grow'&gt; &lt;'flex-shrink'&gt;>? || &lt;'flex-basis'&gt; ]
                  }</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                align-self
                <p>
                  This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by <code
                    class="code-inline">align-items</code>) to be overridden for individual flex items.
                </p>
                <code class="code-block-ws">
                  .item {
                    align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
                  }</code>
              </li>
